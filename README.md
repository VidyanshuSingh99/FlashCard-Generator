üèõÔ∏è Historical Background
India‚Äôs struggle for independence was one of the most significant mass movements in modern history. British colonial rule began formally in 1858, after the Revolt of 1857, although British presence had been established through the East India Company since the 1600s.

Under British rule, India faced:

Economic exploitation

Political suppression

Cultural and social interference

The demand for self-rule (Swaraj) grew strong in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

‚úä Freedom Movement
Key Phases:
Early Nationalism (1885‚Äì1905)

Moderate demands for administrative reform

Leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajpat Rai

Partition of Bengal (1905) sparked mass protests

Gandhian Era (1919‚Äì1947)

Quit India Movement (1942)

Other Leaders:

üó≥Ô∏è Towards Freedom
1935: Government of India Act laid groundwork for self-governance

1946: Elections held; INC and Muslim League emerged as major players

Communal tensions grew, leading to the partition plan

üïäÔ∏è Independence and Partition
India gained independence on August 15, 1947

British India split into two nations: India and Pakistan

Jawaharlal Nehru became India‚Äôs first Prime Minister

Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 due to tensions from partition

The partition led to:

Large-scale violence

Displacement of over 14 million people

Deep communal wounds

üåü Legacy
India‚Äôs independence:

Inspired anti-colonial movements worldwide

Marked the birth of the world‚Äôs largest democracy

Laid the foundation for a sovereign, secular, and democratic republic (1950)

üìå Conclusion
